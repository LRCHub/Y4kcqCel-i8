Choose my brushes, my palletes of vibrant and living color

The sun is brigther, and I'm sleeping with tigers

We want it, we want to be free
Because everything you want everything I'm not in for
We want it, we want to be free
Because everything you want everything I'm don't wish for

You can dream, but can't remain to illusion
There's clear cut dimension for so called division
I stands between the line
Choose my brushes, my palletes of vibrant and living color

The sun is brigther, and I'm sleeping with tigers

We want it, we want to be free
Because everything you want everything I'm not in for
We want it, we want to be free
Because everything you want everything I'm don't wish for

Don't go away, don't go away, don't be afraid
Don't run away, don't run away from everything 2x

We want it, we want to be free
Because everything you want everything I'm not in for
We want it, we want to be free
Because everything you want everything I'm
