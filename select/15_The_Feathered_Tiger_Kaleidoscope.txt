Long time ago i had a dream all about a magic zoo
And the animals that lived there were in love like me
And you
In the dream i wandered slowly in-between each magic
Cage
And the animals looked happy as they played their
Silly games
As the dream unwrapped around me, i could see their
Colours clear
As the minutes split to seconds, i found you were
Standing near

So we wandered through the happy of the little magic
Zoo
And the animals were quiet as they stared at me and
You
As the sun rose we bought ice cream but we couldn't
Eat it all
So we gave it to the animals to keep them very cool
Their happy laughter filled our ears and it made us
Happy too
The animals were beautiful in their yellows, reds and
Blues

But in shadows of their victory, we did find a silent
Cage
And the animal that lived there didn't seem to want to
Play
We looked between the rusty bars through the darkness
Of the cage
And suddenly we saw the sad as the feathered tiger lay
We found a key, unlocked the bars of the feathered
Tiger's cell
And with words of kindness begged him his story to us
Would tell

But he was so very scared, he said we would laugh at
Him
So we led him to the sunshine and played games but let
Him win
We all played amongst the colours in the little magic
Zoo
And soon he was much happier and we both loved him too
But the evening drew in swiftly and the feathered
Tiger cried
He was sad because we had to leave and the sun slipped
From the sky

But we told him to act bravely and to never feel
Unclean
He was the only feathered tiger that we both had ever
Seen
We told him, "only be yourself, you don't really want
To change
To be yourself is beautiful, to be someone else is
Strange"
The feathered tiger disappeared and so did my magic
Zoo
And as i opened up my eyes, there was nothing else but
You
